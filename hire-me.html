                <h1>Dear <span>Hiring Manager,</span> </h1>
                    <h4>
                        Dear Hiring Manager,
I am developing this page to express my keen interest in applying for Programing/IT job positions that may be available within your esteemed organization. As a fourth-year IT student, I have gained an extensive knowledge of various IT domains such as programming, web development, database management, and networking.<br><br>

During my academic journey, I have worked on various projects that have equipped me with the necessary skills to excel in the IT industry. I am well-versed in languages such as Java and C++, and have experience in developing responsive websites using HTML, CSS, PHP and JavaScript. Additionally, I have worked with databases such as MySQL and have a good understanding of how to design, implement, and manage databases.<br><br>

Apart from my technical skills, I am also a self-motivated individual who is constantly looking for opportunities to learn and grow. I am a quick learner and am not afraid to take on new challenges. I believe that these qualities will make me a valuable addition to your team.<br><br>

I am excited about the prospect of joining your organization and contributing my skills and knowledge towards the growth and success of the company. Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to hearing from you.<br><br>

Sincerely,
Hubert Dąbek <br><br>
